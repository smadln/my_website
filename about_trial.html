        <div class="statement">
            <p>Sarah Madeline is a Canadian artist and writer based in Aliso Viejo, California. 
                Madeline was chief editor and contributing writer for <em>SCAN</em>, a contemporary art 
                publication at the University of Manitoba. She later became head curator at The Sunroom 
                Artspace in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Treaty 1 territory. She has since moved to California to 
                continue her practice.
            </p>
            </p>Madelineâ€™s work sifts through new and obsolete technology, to fuse the distinct qualities 
            of each to one another. She utilizes analog and digital processes to reflect on flux and temporality, 
            which are key elements in her practice. Sound, image, and natural materials are often present in her work 
            to synthesize physical and virtual spaces. Madeline incorporates each medium to harness a balance between 
            analyzing the past and anticipating the future.
