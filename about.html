            <p>Sarah Madeline is a Canadian artist and writer based in Aliso Viejo, California. 
            After graduating from her BFA, she became Head Curator at The Sunroom Artspace 
            in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Treaty 1 territory. Madeline was a senior editor and writer for 
            <em>SCAN</em>, a contemporary art publication at the University of Manitoba. She has since 
            moved to California to continue her practice as a visual artist.</p>
            </p>Madeline`s work sifts through new and obsolete technology to fuse the distinct qualities
             of each to one another. Her use of analog and digital processes reflects on flux and temporality,
              which are key elements in her practice. Sound, image, and natural materials are often incorporated
               in her work to synthesize physical and virtual spaces. Each medium is utilized to harness a balance
                between analyzing the past and anticipating the future.</p>
